**Google Code is shutting down**
The project is alive, but I will no longer be submitting code to this Google Code repository.
The code will eventually migrate to github, but at the moment is on a private server.

For convenience sake, here is the original project summary:

Multi-platform Google voice dialer written in QT.

Download location: https://qgvdial.yuvraaj.net/downloader/showAll

Stable releases:
  * BlackBerry 10 (Z10, Q10, Z30, etc): Now available on the BlackBerry World app store!
  * Windows and Debian based Linux: From the link above.
  * Symbian s3, Harmattan (n9): Ovi Store no longer exists for these phones, so please see the link above.
  * Maemo 5: Available from the maemo.org extras-testing repositories.

Should work soon on Mac OSX and more.
